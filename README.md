# Sanctum / SPA authentication

A React app that authenticates with the [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/sanctum) package. See [this repo](https://github.com/unlikenesses/sanctum-backend-example) for an example API that works with this project.

This project is only intended to demonstrate what Sanctum can do. It is not recommended to use it as a model for your own SPA projects.
